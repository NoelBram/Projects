Description: 
    Breadth first search, in this algorithm we use a boolean visited array. For simplicity, 
    it is assumed that all vertices are reachable from the starting vertex. We start from the root or 
    any arbitrary node and mark the node and move to the adjacent unmarked node and 
    continue this loop until there is no unmarked adjacent node. Then backtrack and check for other unmarked 
    nodes and traverse them. Finally print the nodes in the path.
